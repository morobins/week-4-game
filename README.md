# week-4-game
This is a game to practice the applications of jQuery and JavaScript. The finished version uses jQuery selector methods, .on('click), .attr and .addClass mixed with necessary JavaScript to run for loops and arrays.

In the game, the user clicks the various crystals in an attempt to match the Random Number given. Each crystal has a value, so the user must pay attention to the increments that the Current Value is increasing so they can choose the correct values to reach the Random Number.
